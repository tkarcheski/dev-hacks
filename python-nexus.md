To pull files from a Nexus repository (e.g., an artifact repository) rather than Python packages, you would typically interact with Nexus' REST API. Nexus allows you to store and retrieve raw files from hosted or proxy repositories. Here’s how you can retrieve a file from a Nexus repository using Python.

### Example: Pulling a File from Nexus

1. **Using `requests` library**:

You can use Python’s `requests` library to pull files from Nexus, especially if you're dealing with raw files. Here’s an example of how to download a file from a Nexus raw repository.

#### Install `requests`:
If you haven’t installed the `requests` library yet, do so first:

```bash
pip install requests
```

#### Script to Download File:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Nexus configuration
nexus_url = "https://<your-nexus-repo-url>/repository/<repo-name>/<file-path>"
username = "<your-username>"
password = "<your-password>"

# Download the file
response = requests.get(nexus_url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password))

# Check if the download is successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    with open("downloaded_file_name", "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    print("File downloaded successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to download file. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

Replace the following:
- `<your-nexus-repo-url>`: The URL to your Nexus server.
- `<repo-name>`: The repository name where the file is stored.
- `<file-path>`: The path of the file you want to download within the repository.
- `<your-username>` and `<your-password>`: Nexus credentials for authentication.

### Explanation:
- `requests.get` fetches the file from the specified Nexus URL.
- If authentication is required (for private repositories), the `HTTPBasicAuth` is used to provide credentials.
- If the file is retrieved successfully (`status_code == 200`), it is written to the local filesystem as `downloaded_file_name`.

### 2. **Downloading Larger Files with Streaming**:
If the file you're downloading is large, you can use the `stream=True` option to avoid loading the entire file into memory before saving:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

nexus_url = "https://<your-nexus-repo-url>/repository/<repo-name>/<file-path>"
username = "<your-username>"
password = "<your-password>"

# Stream download
response = requests.get(nexus_url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password), stream=True)

if response.status_code == 200:
    with open("large_file_name", "wb") as f:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
            f.write(chunk)
    print("Large file downloaded successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to download file. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

This method downloads the file in chunks and writes each chunk to the file as it’s downloaded, which is helpful for large files.

### 3. **Alternative Authentication: API Token**
If your Nexus instance supports API tokens, you can use an API token instead of a username and password:

```python
api_token = "<your-api-token>"
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_token}'}

response = requests.get(nexus_url, headers=headers, stream=True)
```

### 4. **Nexus API for Listing and Retrieving Files**
You can also list and retrieve files using Nexus' REST API. For example, to get an artifact’s download URL via the Nexus 3 REST API:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Search Nexus for a specific artifact
search_url = "https://<your-nexus-repo-url>/service/rest/v1/search/assets"
params = {
    "repository": "<repo-name>",
    "group": "<group-id>",
    "name": "<artifact-name>",
    "version": "<artifact-version>"
}

response = requests.get(search_url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password), params=params)

# Parse JSON response and get download URL
if response.status_code == 200:
    assets = response.json()['items']
    for asset in assets:
        download_url = asset['downloadUrl']
        print(f"Download URL: {download_url}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve artifacts. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

This example fetches metadata about assets from Nexus and extracts the download URL, which you can then use to pull the actual file.
