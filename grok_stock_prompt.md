Generate a table summarizing the projected stock values for [list of stocks] from [start year] to [end year] with the following parameters:
- Monthly investment per stock: $500
- Annual growth rates:
  - [Stock 1]: [Growth Rate 1]%
  - [Stock 2]: [Growth Rate 2]%
  - [Continue for each stock]

The table should include:
- Each year from [start year] to [end year]
- Total amount invested by the end of each year
- Projected value for each stock at the end of each year

Please note that these projections should not include dividends, stock splits, transaction fees, or inflation adjustments. Use the format:

| Year | Total Invested | [Stock 1] | [Stock 2] | ... | [Stock N] |
|------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| [Y1] | [Total Y1]     | [Value Y1]| [Value Y1]| ... | [Value Y1]|
| [Y2] | [Total Y2]     | [Value Y2]| [Value Y2]| ... | [Value Y2]|
| ...  | ...            | ...       | ...       | ... | ...       |
| [YN] | [Total YN]     | [Value YN]| [Value YN]| ... | [Value YN]|

Example usage:
Replace [list of stocks] with the actual stocks you want to analyze, e.g., "Intel, NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla".
Replace [start year] and [end year] with your desired investment period, e.g., "2024" and "2030".
Replace [Growth Rate X] with the estimated annual growth rate for each stock.
