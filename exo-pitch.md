  - Git for version control.
  - Node.js (optional, for frontend components).
  - NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (if using NVIDIA GPUs).

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Install Python and Git**:
   - Download from official websites and add to PATH.
2. **Clone Exo Repository**:
   - Run `git clone https://github.com/exo-explore/exo.git`.
3. **Create Virtual Environment**:
   - Use `python -m venv exo_env` and activate it.
4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. **Configure Exo**:
   - Set up `config.yaml` with cluster details.
6. **Start Exo Services**:
   - Run `python -m exo.server` and `python -m exo.worker`.

## **Slide 7: Configuring the Cluster (`config.yaml`)**

### **Key Elements**

- **Cluster Name**:
  - Unique identifier for the cluster.
- **Devices Section**:
  - Lists each device with:
    - **Hostname or IP Address**.
    - **Roles**: `compute`, `coordinator`, `storage`.
    - **Resource Constraints**: `max_memory`, `max_cores`, `gpu`.
- **Networking Configuration**:
  - `discovery`: Set to `auto` or specify devices manually.

### **Roles Explained**

- **Compute**: Handles computational tasks.
- **Coordinator**: Manages task distribution across the cluster.
- **Storage**: Stores data and models for cluster access.

## **Slide 8: Example `config.yaml` for Our Systems**

```yaml
cluster_name: engineering_cluster

devices:
  - hostname: system-a.local
    roles: [coordinator, storage]
    max_memory: 128GB
    max_cores: 16
    gpu: false

  - hostname: system-b.local
    roles: [compute]
    max_memory: 128GB
    max_cores: 16
    gpu: true

  - hostname: system-c.local
    roles: [compute]
    max_memory: 128GB
    max_cores: 16
    gpu: true

network:
  discovery: auto
```

### **Explanation**

- **System A**:
  - Acts as the **coordinator** and **storage** node.
  - High memory and core count for managing the cluster.
- **System B & C**:
  - Serve as **compute** nodes with GPUs.
  - Ideal for heavy AI computational tasks.
