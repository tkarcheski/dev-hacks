The error message you're seeing, `error getting credentials - err: exit status 1, out: `, typically indicates that Docker is having trouble accessing or retrieving credentials needed for interacting with Docker Hub or other registries. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. **Check Docker Credentials Store**
   - This issue often arises due to problems with the Docker credentials store. You can try resetting or reconfiguring it:
     1. Open the Docker Desktop settings (if you're using Docker Desktop).
     2. Go to the "Security" or "General" tab.
     3. Reset credentials or reconfigure the credentials store.

### 2. **Re-login to Docker**
   - Sometimes, simply re-logging into Docker can resolve the issue:
     ```bash
     docker logout
     docker login
     ```
   - Re-enter your Docker Hub credentials when prompted.

### 3. **Remove and Recreate the Docker Credentials File**
   - The credentials file might be corrupted. You can try removing it:
     1. Remove the credentials file (usually located at `~/.docker/config.json`):
        ```bash
        rm ~/.docker/config.json
        ```
     2. Run `docker login` again to recreate the credentials file.

### 4. **Update Docker**
   - Ensure that Docker is up to date. Sometimes, updating Docker resolves credential-related issues.

### 5. **Check Docker Configuration**
   - Verify if the `credsStore` or `credHelpers` fields in the Docker config file (`~/.docker/config.json`) are correctly set. If unsure, you can temporarily remove or comment them out and try running your command again.

### 6. **Manually Set the Credentials**
   - As a workaround, you can manually set your credentials in the `~/.docker/config.json` file, though this is not recommended due to security concerns.

If none of these steps work, there might be a deeper issue with your Docker installation or environment, in which case further investigation would be needed.
