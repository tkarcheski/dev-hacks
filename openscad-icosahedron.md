### Project Overview

In this project, we're designing a 20-sided die, commonly referred to as a **d20**, which is a standard die used in tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons. A **d20** is based on an **icosahedron**, which is a polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangle faces. Each face of this die needs to be numbered from 1 to 20. The main tasks are:

1. **Create the geometric shape** of the icosahedron using the `polyhedron` function in OpenSCAD.
2. **Add numbers** to each face of the icosahedron.
3. **Ensure correct placement and orientation** of the numbers on each face.
4. **Prepare the model for 3D printing**, with numbers either engraved or extruded on the die.

// PROJECT: Creating a numbered d20 die (icosahedron) for 3D printing in OpenSCAD
// TASK: Build an icosahedron, add engraved numbers, and ensure proper orientation of numbers.

// The Golden Ratio (phi) is crucial for determining the vertex coordinates of the icosahedron
phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2;  // Approx. 1.618033

// Vertices of an icosahedron (d20)
// These coordinates define the points in 3D space that form the vertices of the icosahedron.
// The vertices are determined based on the golden ratio.
vertices = [
  [-1,  phi,  0],
  [ 1,  phi,  0],
  [-1, -phi,  0],
  [ 1, -phi,  0],
  [ 0, -1,  phi],
  [ 0,  1,  phi],
  [ 0, -1, -phi],
  [ 0,  1, -phi],
  [ phi,  0, -1],
  [ phi,  0,  1],
  [-phi,  0, -1],
  [-phi,  0,  1]
];

// Faces of the icosahedron (d20)
// Each face is made of three vertices, forming a triangular face.
// These are index references to the vertices defined above.
faces = [
  [0, 11, 5],  // Face 1
  [0, 5, 1],   // Face 2
  [0, 1, 7],   // Face 3
  [0, 7, 10],  // Face 4
  [0, 10, 11], // Face 5
  [1, 5, 9],   // Face 6
  [5, 11, 4],  // Face 7
  [11, 10, 2], // Face 8
  [10, 7, 6],  // Face 9
  [7, 1, 8],   // Face 10
  [3, 9, 4],   // Face 11
  [3, 4, 2],   // Face 12
  [3, 2, 6],   // Face 13
  [3, 6, 8],   // Face 14
  [3, 8, 9],   // Face 15
  [4, 9, 5],   // Face 16
  [2, 4, 11],  // Face 17
  [6, 2, 10],  // Face 18
  [8, 6, 7],   // Face 19
  [9, 8, 1]    // Face 20
];

// Numbering details
// These variables define the depth of the number (extrusion) and the size of the text.
// Adjust these values depending on how prominent or subtle you want the numbers to appear on the die.
number_depth = 0.5;  // Depth of number engraving
number_size = 5;     // Size of the numbers on the faces

// MODULE: Adding a number to a specific face of the d20.
// The face's vertices are used to find the center of the face where the number should be placed.
// Then the number is placed at the center of that face, potentially rotated if needed.
module add_number(face_vertices, number) {
    // Find the center of the triangular face by averaging the coordinates of its three vertices.
    center = (face_vertices[0] + face_vertices[1] + face_vertices[2]) / 3;
    
    // Placeholder for rotation values; each face may need to be rotated for correct number orientation.
    // This is a basic placeholder rotation. You would adjust this based on each face's orientation.
    rotation = [0, 0, 0];  

    // Define the number shape by translating it to the face center, rotating it, and extruding the text.
    number_shape = translate(center + [0, 0, number_depth/2])  // Position the number at the face center
                   rotate(rotation)                            // Apply rotation if needed
                   linear_extrude(height = number_depth)        // Engrave or extrude the number
                   text(str(number), size = number_size, valign = "center", halign = "center");  // Add number text

    // Return the shape of the number to be subtracted from or added to the d20.
    number_shape;
}

// Create the d20 with all 20 faces and add the numbers to each face.
// The 'difference()' function subtracts the numbers from the die's surface, creating engravings.
difference() {
    // The icosahedron itself, created from the vertices and faces defined above.
    polyhedron(vertices, faces);  // d20 shape

    // Loop through all faces of the icosahedron and place numbers 1 to 20.
    for(i = [0:len(faces)-1]) {
        face_vertices = [vertices[faces[i][0]], vertices[faces[i][1]], vertices[faces[i][2]]];  // Get the vertices for the current face
        add_number(face_vertices, i + 1);  // Call the add_number module to engrave the number (i + 1) on the face
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Vertices**: These are the 12 unique points in 3D space that form the icosahedron. The points are based on the golden ratio to ensure the correct proportions.

2. **Faces**: Each triangular face of the icosahedron is defined by 3 vertices. For example, the first face uses the vertices at indices `[0, 11, 5]`.

3. **Number Placement**:
   - For each triangular face, the module `add_number` computes the center of the face.
   - The `translate` function places the number at the center of the face, while `rotate` can be used to adjust the orientation of the numbers.
   - The `text()` function generates the number, and `linear_extrude` engraves or extrudes the number on the face.

4. **Difference Function**: The `difference()` function carves out the numbers from the surface of the die, creating an engraved effect. If you want the numbers to be extruded (raised above the surface), you can modify the module to add instead of subtracting the numbers.

### Next Steps:
- **Number Rotation**: The placeholder rotation (`rotation = [0, 0, 0]`) needs to be adjusted for each face to ensure the numbers are oriented correctly on the die. This will require manual tuning or a more advanced algorithm to detect face orientation and apply appropriate rotations.
- **Finalize for 3D Printing**: Once the numbers are properly oriented, the model can be exported as an STL file for 3D printing. Depending on how you want the numbers to appear (engraved or raised), you can adjust the extrusion parameters.

This OpenSCAD script generates a fully numbered d20 die that can be used for 3D printing, with customizable number size and depth.
