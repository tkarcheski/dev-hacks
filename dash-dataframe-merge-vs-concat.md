To combine three datasets (dataframes) in a Dash application, you can use several methods depending on how you want to combine them. Here are some common approaches:

### 1. **Concatenation (Stacking)**
If you want to stack the dataframes on top of each other (vertically), you can use `pd.concat`.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assume df1, df2, df3 are your dataframes
combined_df = pd.concat([df1, df2, df3], axis=0, ignore_index=True)
```

### 2. **Merging (Joining)**
If you want to merge the dataframes based on a common column (like a SQL join), use `pd.merge`.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assume df1, df2, df3 are your dataframes
# If you have a common column named 'key' you want to merge on
combined_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key').merge(df3, on='key')
```

### 3. **Concatenation (Side-by-Side)**
If you want to concatenate the dataframes side by side (horizontally), you can also use `pd.concat` but change the axis to 1.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assume df1, df2, df3 are your dataframes
combined_df = pd.concat([df1, df2, df3], axis=1)
```

### 4. **Custom Combination**
If you need a more custom approach, you can use various Pandas functions, such as `apply`, `join`, or even write a custom loop to combine the dataframes.

### Example in Dash
Here is an example of how you might use these techniques in a Dash application:

```python
import dash
from dash import dcc, html
import pandas as pd
import dash_table

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

# Sample dataframes
df1 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [7, 8, 9], 'C': [10, 11, 12]})
df3 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [13, 14, 15], 'D': [16, 17, 18]})

# Combine the dataframes
combined_df = pd.concat([df1, df2, df3], axis=1)

app.layout = html.Div([
    dash_table.DataTable(
        data=combined_df.to_dict('records'),
        columns=[{'name': i, 'id': i} for i in combined_df.columns]
    )
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

### Steps:
1. **Generate the DataFrames**: This can be done using functions or inputs from your Dash app.
2. **Combine DataFrames**: Depending on the method that best suits your needs, combine the dataframes using concatenation, merging, or another method.
3. **Use in Dash**: Convert the combined dataframe to a format that Dash can display (e.g., a `dash_table.DataTable`).

Let me know if you have a specific combination in mind, and I can tailor the solution further.
