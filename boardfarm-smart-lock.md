### Title: Replace Boardfarm Door Lock with Badge-In Lock for Streamlined Access and Comprehensive Auditability

---

**As a** user of the boardfarm,  
**I want** to replace the current slow and cumbersome number pad lock box system with a faster badge-in lock system,  
**so that** access to the boardfarm is efficient, seamless, and fully auditable.

---

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Seamless Badge-In Lock Installation:**
   - The existing door lock must be replaced with a badge-in system that is significantly faster than the current number pad lock.
   - The system must allow users to badge in within 2 seconds or less, providing near-instant access.

2. **Drastically Reduced Friction:**
   - The new system must remove the need for manual code entry or key usage, eliminating unnecessary delays and reducing user frustration.
   - The setup should be intuitive, allowing users to badge in without additional training or hassle.
   
3. **Comprehensive Auditable Logs:**
   - The system must generate **real-time, detailed access logs**, capturing both entry and exit events with user ID and timestamp.
   - Logs must be accessible in a user-friendly format for audits and compliance, with no delays in updating data.
   - Any attempt to tamper with or bypass the system should trigger immediate alerts.

4. **Top-Tier Security and Reliability:**
   - The badge-in system must provide a higher level of security than the current number pad system, with encrypted badge data and robust user authentication.
   - A backup access solution must be in place to ensure no downtime in case of system failures, such as a secure master override.

5. **Zero Compromise on Testing:**
   - The system must be rigorously tested for all edge cases, ensuring no disruptions in boardfarm operations.
   - Testing should include failover mechanisms and emergency access scenarios, simulating power failures, network outages, and other contingencies.

6. **Immediate Improvement of Workflow:**
   - The transition to the badge-in system should be designed to **immediately improve daily workflow**, minimizing access delays that have historically wasted time and created frustration.
   - Documentation and support must be provided, but the goal is for the system to be **so intuitive that minimal training is needed**.

### Tasks:

1. Evaluate badge-in lock systems with fast response times and seamless integration capabilities.
2. Select and acquire a lock system that drastically improves access speed and user experience.
3. Install the badge-in system on the boardfarm door and configure access for all users.
4. Implement real-time logging and ensure logs are fully auditable with instant access.
5. Conduct testing, ensuring both speed and security requirements are met.
6. Roll out the new system across all access points of the boardfarm.
7. Provide quick-start guides for users but design for minimal training and ongoing user interaction.
8. Decommission the old lock system immediately after successful implementation.

### Definition of Done:

- The new badge-in lock is fully operational and users can access the boardfarm with zero delays or unnecessary steps.
- Logs are complete, auditable, and provide real-time access data without system delays.
- User frustration with the previous system is eliminated, and workflow efficiency is noticeably improved.
- The old number pad lock is retired without any impact on boardfarm operations.
